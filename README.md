C projects and exercises

C programs I wrote following projects and exercises from books, tutorials, and other stuff I just came up with. 

Wang-chap2-project: UNIX FILE SYSTEM TREE SIMULATOR - This is the suggested project from the 2nd chapter of K C Wang's book 'Systems Programming in Unix/Linux' (2018). It consists of a simulation of the Unix File System Tree using a Binary Tree structure. The tree may be modified/traversed using shell-like commands such as mkdir, rmdir, ls, cd, etc.
