C projects and exercises

C programs I wrote following projects and exercises from books, tutorials, and other stuff I just came up with. 

<strong>Wang-chap2-project</strong>: UNIX FILE SYSTEM TREE SIMULATOR - This is the suggested project from the 2nd chapter of K C Wang's book 'Systems Programming in Unix/Linux' (2018). It consists of a simulation of the Unix File System Tree using a Binary Tree structure. The tree may be modified/traversed using shell-like commands such as mkdir, rmdir, ls, cd, etc.<p>The project uses  editline library to implement some shell facilities (line editing and command history). So you should type the parameter -ledit  when compiling with gcc.

<strong>qsortthread</strong>: Implementation of a generic quicksort function with the same interface as glibc's qsort using multiple threads. 

<strong>fresh</strong>:Freixo's Shell :P This is the suggested project from the 3rd chapter of K C Wang's book. A basic shell program. It's supposed to support pipes, but I'm still working on that. Like the File System Tree Simulator, this project uses editline library.
